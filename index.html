                    Leonardo's most famous painting of the 1490s is The Last
                    Supper, which represents the last meal shared by Jesus with
                    his disciples before his capture and death, and shows the
                    moment when Jesus has just said "one of you will betray me",
                    and the consternation that this statement caused.
