# Tribute Page for Leonardo da Vinci


## About

The objective of this project is to build a tribute page for Leonardo da Vinci, one of the most celebrated artists and thinkers of the Renaissance era. The page should provide an overview of his life, work, and achievements, and showcase some of his most iconic paintings and drawings.


## User Stories:

- Your tribute page should have a main element with a corresponding id of "main", which contains all other elements.
- You should see an element with an id of "title" that contains a string describing the subject of the tribute page.
- You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of "img-div".
- Within the "#img-div" element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image".
- Within the "#img-div" element, you should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in "#img-div".
- You should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info" that contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page.
- You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link" that links to an outside site containing additional information about the subject of the tribute page. Hint: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab.
- Your "#image" should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size.
- Your "img" element should be centered within its parent element.
